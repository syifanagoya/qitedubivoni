His last known address was in north London.</p><p>"Enquiries undertaken so far indicate that Sylvestre left the UK on Tuesday, 2 August. Officers from the Met's Specialist Crime Command continue to work with partner agencies to locate and arrest him. Sylvestre should not be approached."</p><figure itemscope data-test=article-body-image itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject data-js=article-body-image itemprop=image class="article-body-image section"><span itemprop=caption data-test=caption>Katie Piper, 38, who now works as a TV presenter, was awarded an OBE in the 2022 New Year Honours</span> <span class=e-caption__credit itemprop=copyrightHolder data-test=credit><span class=e-caption__credit-description>Credit</span>: David M Benett</span></figure><p>Sylvestre, who was then 19, attacked Ms Piper in Golders Green, North London, with acid in 2008 on the orders of her obsessive ex-boyfriend Daniel Lynch.</p><p>He was jailed for life the following year, with a minimum term of six years.</p><p>Lynch was jailed for life with a minimum of 16 years for sexually assaulting Ms Piper and telling Sylvestre to throw acid over her. He cannot be considered for release until 2025.</p><p>Lynch and Ms Piper had dated briefly before the steroid-fuelled martial arts fan, who had a previous conviction for pouring boiling water over a man, became obsessively jealous.</p><p>In court, Lynch and Sylvestre were told by Judge Nicholas Browne QC they were "the face of pure evil".</p><p>In a victim impact statement to the court, Ms Piper wrote: "When the acid was thrown at me, it felt like I was burning in hell. It was an indescribable, unique, torturous pain.</p><p>"I have lost my future, my career, my spirit, my body, my looks, my dignityâ€¦ the list goes on. All I am left with is an empty shell. A part of me has died that will never come back. This is worse than death."</p><p>Sylvestre became eligible for parole in 2015 but his application was blocked after he was deemed unfit for release.</p><p>Another application in 2018 was successful and he was freed.</p><p>At the time Ms Piper had tweeted: "This is a really difficult time for me.</p><p>"I am trying to come to terms with the decision and this is something I need to deal with.</p><p>"Over the past two weeks Strictly (Come Dancing) has already given me such a welcome and positive distraction from my past.</p><p>"Whilst there is never a good time to hear this news, I am glad I have this new journey to concentrate on. Thank you for your continued support. Love Katie."</p><p>In 2019, Sylvestre was recalled to jail for an unrelated incident.</p><p>Sylvestre was granted parole again in 2020 and was released after errors in his prosecution emerged.</p><p>It is not clear why Sylvestre has again been recalled to prison.</p><p>Offenders who are released from jail are subject to strict licence conditions, which can include exclusion zones. Failure to comply can result in an immediate recall to prison.</p><p>Piper, 38, who now works as a TV presenter, was awarded an OBE in the 2022 New Year Honours for services to charity and victims of burns and other disfigurement injuries.</p><p>She is best known for sharing her story about surviving the attack in the documentary Katie: My Beautiful Face.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwfo9raWhpYGR%2BcXvKmquinV2ltrGx0axkmpuZmXqiwNOamqSdomKzrbHDZpqorZ6pv7p507CmZqWfo8Gpv4yanqhn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-cody-whitehairs-wife-hannah.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Cody Whitehairs Wife Hannah?">&larr;
