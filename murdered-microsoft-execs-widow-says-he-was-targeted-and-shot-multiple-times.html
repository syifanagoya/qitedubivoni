At 7.30pm, he dropped his nine-year-old twins at his ex-wife’s Shanna’s house after taking them out for dinner, and was around 2miles away when he encountered a tire in the middle of the road.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As soon as he got out of the car, he&nbsp;was shot multiple times at close range while his toddler daughter sat nearby in her car seat. His body was found at 9.50pm.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It has been two months since his killing but police are yet to make any arrests.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Their only lead is surveillance footage of a blue, 2004-2008 Ford F150 truck that was filmed by surveillance cameras near the crime scene at around the time of the shooting.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In an interview with DailyMail.com, Jared’s widow Kirsten revealed that he was loved by ‘the majority’ of people in his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;She said that whoever murdered her husband had planned it meticulously, picking the only blind spot in an affluent neighborhood filled with Ring doorbell cameras.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘For it to be in that area, someone knew what they were doing. There are no cameras, there are no houses there. There’s no Ring doorbell. It’s trees and a one-way street,’ Kirsten said from the couple’s St. Augustine home with her youngest daughter, seven-month-old London, nearby.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>Scroll down for video&nbsp;</span></p><img data-lazyloaded=1 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/04/15/21/56664011-10721987-Jared_Bridegan_33_was_murdered_on_February_16_in_a_targeted_atta-a-26_1650053244058.jpg decoding=async id=i-e26d7a0b3fe69385 height=581 width=470 alt="Jared Bridegan, 33, was murdered on February 16 in a targeted attack in Jacksonville Beach, Florida.
