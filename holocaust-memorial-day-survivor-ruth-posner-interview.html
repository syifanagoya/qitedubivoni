Now, the Holocaust survivor sits in her study, a room lined with posters and clippings from her acting days, as well as a towering bookshelf – a nod to her lifelong trade in storytelling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5dc7fcb593e3-ruth-posner-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eO6GTonVfCL data-wc=7><strong>Actress, dancer and Holocaust survivor Ruth Posner</strong></p><p id=e6nC29EjAP8 data-wc=35>To mark <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Holocaust Memorial Day</a>, the 93-year-old has partnered with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Holocaust Educational Trust</a> to share her story in the hope that current and future generations never forget the horror of the Shoah – especially in the wake of rising antisemitism.</p><p id=eS7neIuI16E5 data-wc=20>"How much do you want me to tell you about my life?" she asks, so we start at the beginning.</p><h2>Ruth's experience of antisemitism as a young girl</h2><p id=eVvMTCcQELYE data-wc=59>Growing up, Ruth says she had two identities. As a young girl, she considered herself Jewish but primarily thought herself a Pole. She attended a Catholic school, the only Jewish student enrolled, and fully immersed herself in Polish traditions. Her mother was a fashion designer and her humanist father was a local government official. Both were murdered in Treblinka.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/899d3d5b8605-ruth-child-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eGR4NpovHDm_ data-wc=10><strong>Ruth was born into a secular Jewish family in 1930</strong></p><p id=eTU75X-drCpu data-wc=93>Ruth's first experience of antisemitism occurred when she was a schoolgirl. "I never denied my Jewishness, but I wasn't that involved. So, it was a terrible shock, when very near the outbreak of war in 1939, I was outside playing, and a girl came up to me and said: 'You are a Jew! You killed our Lord, and you should be punished! ' It was an utter shock. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I ran home to my mother crying, she tried to pacify me. I didn't understand what was happening."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/167b0bb3b687-ruth-father-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ex4Fs6wPqHju data-wc=8><strong>Ruth as a young girl with her father</strong></p><p id=earywxXzlSso data-wc=113>Like millions of Jews, the former actress' life took a drastic turn following the outbreak of the Second World War. One day, two Gestapo men came to Ruth's family home and gave the family fifteen minutes to pack their things and leave. She recalls: "They had guns. My mother, who was an incredible woman with a heart of gold, said something very innocent to one of the Gestapo. She said: '<strong>You wear a black uniform, but surely your heart isn’t black.'</strong> <strong>The man swiped her and hit her.</strong> That was my first introduction to that kind of behavior. We had to leave. We left our home, and we were led to a ghetto."</p><h2>Ruth moves to the Radom ghetto</h2><p id=e9vxTMT5ISzq data-wc=64>In the Radom ghetto, a young Ruth first encountered Hasidic Jewish culture. She recalls seeing men with payots and kippahs, in addition to hearing the cries of her brethren being loaded into trucks and taken away. Her experience was a stark reminder that the Nazis did not care if you went to synagogue or kept kosher. Jews were a homogenous race to be exterminated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9a6bcfce32e6-ghetto2-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e1zebabBM_17 data-wc=11><strong>German soldiers rounding up Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943</strong></p><p id=eCmZ5a7NLSdK data-wc=57>Determined to keep his daughter safe, Ruth's father obtained a false passport for his only child with the help of his Catholic friends. He then arranged for Ruth and her aunt Lola&nbsp;to work as slave laborers in a leather goods factory. Ruth was beaten, but she notes it was still better than being in the ghetto.</p><p id=eDsqpVSjGYbN data-wc=9>The next segment of Ruth's story is truly astonishing.</p><h2>Ruth's chance escape from the Nazis</h2><p id=e0qxdaz6b-Ui data-wc=81>"The Germans were very conscious of hygiene," she chuckles, as she recounts her escape. "The conditions were bad in the factory, so the Germans would take us and march us down the street to very close by bath houses to get rid of fleas and lice. The bathhouse was on the edge of the ghetto. Opposite it was the Aryan side. If you wanted to dare escape, you had to find a way of finding the road to the other side."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/84227945cb57-ghetto1-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=exV76EJhpO8s data-wc=14><strong>Star of David attached to a street car in the Warsaw&nbsp;ghetto circa 1939-43</strong></p><p id=eP4jp_CU0GUE data-wc=58>"My aunt said we won't escape today; we would do it next week. I remember her words:<strong> 'It's dangerous. If we are seen, we will be shot. But if we stay here, it will be certain death. Trying to cross the street, it's a probable death.' </strong>I was about thirteen at the time. This is what we did."</p><p id=eA-0BPaIUzL- data-wc=26>Two Gestapo came together to light a cigarette. Ruth and her aunt slipped off their Star of David armbands and walked across the road without detection.</p><p id=esUscEskumRO data-wc=65>The squalid ghetto landscape and sound of Nazi gunfire seem very far away while speaking with Ruth today, dressed in a modest black turtleneck and a silver necklace portraying a Hindu deity. It's difficult to conjure images of her as a teenager slipping away behind the backs of the Nazis. "My life consists of many strange coincidences, and this was the start of incredible luck."</p><h2>Ruth describes the horrors of war</h2><p id=eJ8bBgLp9Aw4 data-wc=68>Upon her escape, Ruth's binary identity gained another layer. To evade recapture, she changed her name to Irena Slabowska as Ruth is a biblical Jewish name, and hid with a Catholic family. The dawn of the Warsaw Uprising catalyzed yet another dramatic rift in Ruth's adolescence. She was imprisoned as a Polish Catholic in Germany and subsequently put on a train to Essen where the Allies were bombing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a46f4ca96637-ruth-today-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e_kWUCNHvn7o data-wc=11><strong>Aged thirteen, the aspiring dancer escaped the ghetto with her aunt</strong></p><p id=ekrb4eCuVO8Y data-wc=118>Now persecuted as a Pole, Ruth described the horrors she witnessed as she fled from the falling bombs. "We started to hear airplanes and bombs falling. The Allies' planes landed and the machine guns came out. I couldn’t find my aunt for quite some time. <strong>Many people died. There were dead bodies lying around. Everyone was running.</strong> The Germans were running. We were running. I found my aunt and we came to a hut, and we found German farmers. We said we are prisoners of war and asked if they could give us some water. They had no idea we were Jews. We offered to work for them, I learned how to milk cows and they kept us!"</p><p id=ena4wuUSL_iL data-wc=118>A slice of bacon led to the next stroke of luck in Ruth's tale. After liberation, the pair were taken to a compound by the Allies still under the guise of being Catholic, where Ruth's aunt Lola unknowingly served a Jewish RAF Squadron leader breakfast which consisted of bacon and eggs. The soldier's rejection of the meat immediately revealed his Jewish identity and upon picking up on Ruth's aunt's shocked reaction, he confided in her that he was looking for hidden Jews and if she might know where any were. Squadron leader Scott ensured Ruth was put on the Kindertransport to England, her new home, while her aunt ventured to Brussels to find her few surviving family members.</p><h2>Ruth's personal tragedy at the hands of the Nazis</h2><p id=eHuW0pIhJxv7 data-wc=14>Ruth's entire family, including her parents, uncles, most aunts, and cousins were all murdered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1be16089f4de-treblinka-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eB9Pggc7j9Xw data-wc=8><strong>Treblinka concentration camp, where Ruth's parents were murdered</strong></p><p id=eD4Qci0estQq data-wc=110>Ruth has retained a calm and stoic manner while detailing her harrowing childhood memories. Yet, pure fury begins to simmer in her tone. <strong>"This evil was the worst thing of humanity. I don't like to talk about it, but I just have to tell you. </strong>My aunt's children aged eight and six didn’t even know they were Jews. They didn’t come from a religious home they were being hidden by a farmer. I don’t know and will never know exactly what happened, but somebody denounced them. Not the farmer, but somebody else who knew they were Jewish kids in hiding. At six and eight old were taken out and shot."</p><p id=eBFVVua3BTo0 data-wc=4>She begins to cry.</p><p id=egql70MvIClG data-wc=27>"To take kids and shoot them, who don’t even know what they are – I will never forgive for that. And I will always talk about it."</p><p id=e_AWpwjDCaS9 data-wc=98>"I carry this burden in my heart all the time because I have no family.<strong> I didn't want to talk about my experience, and I didn’t want people to feel sorry for me. But what made me talk about it and even scream about it, is the resurgence of antisemitism. </strong>People say it didn’t exist. It's because the trouble we have with Palestine and Israel, how Judaism has been mixed with those complex issues, it has fuelled antisemitism. I said, no. Now, I am going to scream about it wherever possible. I going to talk about it."</p><h2>Ruth on antisemitism today</h2><p id=eJyn8g2EME6N data-wc=31>A large issue Jews face today is the conflation of Zionism and Judaism, which in turn leads to the justification of antisemitism. Ruth does not shy away from the convoluted topic.</p><p id=eVCQnJWWcsoF data-wc=60>"People see Jews as one entity instead of individual people. It's such a mistake. A terrible mistake. <strong>People think Jews are money grabbers. </strong>But wait a minute, Jews, for a long time, were not allowed to own land or do certain professions. They could deal with money so yes, they developed skills. But it doesn’t necessarily mean we’re all rich."</p><p id=e-pEUFZtu_2V><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/678033ff2df4-ruth-smiling-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=ecPzNR-w3jxb data-wc=12><strong>Ruth pursued a successful career in acting upon her escape from Germany</strong></p><p id=e5rtCttN_OUf data-wc=91>"This business of generalisation is so dangerous. People must learn this and open their minds. I have family members who live in Israel who are very critical of things happening in the country. But also, they understand how difficult the situation is. There are Jews who are not even interested in Israel because they do not connect with it. The comedian <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>David Baddiel</a> says he's not interested in Israel because he is not Israeli. <strong>Just because I am Jewish, do not put me in that bag or blame me for what happens there."</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6d0e420af71f-hitler-youth-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eXjmZ6A2Hfaq data-wc=7><strong>Children of the Hitler Youth circa 1935</strong></p><p id=eSF2Kj5ezP1a data-wc=140>Her plea not to generalise about communities extends to Germans: " I find it very difficult to make a comment about generalities. I was in a play about the Second World War, and we were invited to perform it in Germany. People said: 'You're going to Germany? How can you?' And I said: 'Yes, I am going to Germany. It's a whole new generation now.' We performed the play at universities in many different towns. The chancellor of one university came out to greet me and said: 'You don’t know what this means to me for you to be here. I was a Hitler Youth during the war. I wore the swastika. I was very proud of my uniform. I was eight years old. We must go through this and learn from it and change the world we live in."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e6e944c0ced2-ruth-bw-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eIWWdq5DXQ7y data-wc=12><strong>Ruth has partnered with Holocaust Education Trust to share her remarkable story</strong></p><p id=eAJBfDYxhCZM data-wc=57>"So, therefore, when Jewish people say: 'Oh I could never go to Germany.' No – you cannot generalise. There was a certain culture that created what was created in the war. But not every individual subscribes to that. <strong>You cannot generalise about Jews or Germans or anyone else. We are people. We have different characters. Different proclivities."</strong></p><p id=eqRDgzcTfSCI data-wc=22>The Holocaust Educational Trust's key proverb hangs in my mind. The Holocaust didn’t start in the gas chambers – but with words.</p><p id=eF98Ag5s-FQq data-wc=61>Before offering up an impassioned parting note to stay positive and fight generalisation, Ruth looks to the future <strong>"There is hope when I meet young people, who are just working in order to make the world a better place. In order to understand what happened and take care that it shouldn't happen again. To me, that is the most important thing."</strong></p><p id=eFniH2pFwMhk data-wc=77></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
