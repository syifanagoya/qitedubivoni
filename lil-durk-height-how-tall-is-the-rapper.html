According to public records, he was born on the 19th of October in the year 1992. His place of birth was in Englewood, a community you would find in the south side of Chicago, Illinois.</p><p>Durk Derrick Banks, as he was named at birth, had a rough upbringing and was raised without his father who was imprisoned when the rapper was only seven months old. Durk started actively pursuing a career in the music industry when he was 17. At that age, he reportedly became a father and the responsibilities that came with that saw him drop out of high school. He started working on consolidating his popularity on platforms like YouTube and Myspace.</p><p>With time, he gained mainstream recognition and has thus far dropped six studio albums.</p><h2><strong>How Tall is Lil Durk?</strong></h2><p>Lil Durk isn’t the tallest man you would meet on any day. At 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm), he might be considered tall in some countries but he is not as tall as the average American male.</p><h3><strong>Lil Durk’s Height Compared to the Average American Male</strong></h3><p>As culled from a global study regarding human height across the globe, the United States of America is one of the nations with the tallest people in the world. In fact, it is said that the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>country used to be the tallest nation in the world</a>.</p><p>After the second world war, the North American nation began recording a decline in the height of its population. Americans are no longer the tallest in the world but remain one of the countries with the tallest people. Right now, the average American male stands at 5 feet 9.3 inches (176 cm).</p><p>Based on that, one could see that Lil Durk isn’t as tall as most of the men in his country. A majority of American men are taller than him by 2.3 inches (176 cm). Be that as it may, the American rapper would be considered a tall fellow in nations like Timor where the average height for men is 5 feet 3 inches (160 cm).</p><h3><strong>How Tall is Lil Durk Compared to Other Hip Hop Artists?</strong></h3><p>Hip Hop has spread across the globe, so much that you would find a rapper in practically any country of the world. Based on that, it wouldn’t be wrong to conclude that the height of these artists varies, as much as people’s height differs around the world.</p><p>The average height for hip-hop artists may not be known, but we can assert that Lil Durk isn’t one of the least tall in the industry. For instance, he is taller than Canadian rapper Tory Lanez who stands at 5 feet 3 inches (160 cm), Lil Wayne, Lil Jon, and Kendrick Lamar who respectively stand at 5 feet 5 inches, 5 feet 6 inches, and 5 feet 6 inches.</p><h4><strong>Lil Durk’s Height Compared to Meek Mill</strong></h4><p>Lil Durk and Meek Mill have been friends for quite a while. Like Durk, Meek is also an American rapper. Born and raised in Philadelphia, the largest city of Pennsylvania, Meek Mill has been active in the music industry since 2003. He has thus far dropped five studio albums in a body of work that includes six extended plays, three collaborative albums, eleven mixtapes, and one compilation album.</p><p>Meek Mill has sold millions of records and has received some of the most coveted awards in the business. He&nbsp;was among the artists Lil Durk featured in his seventh mixtape, They Forgot. The two toured together in 2019 and have collaborated multiple times. Meek Mill is significantly taller than Lil Durk: he stands at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m).</p><h4><strong>How Tall is Lil Durk Compared to Lil Dicky?</strong></h4><p>David Andrew Burd, professionally known as Lil Dicky, is also an American rapper.

The rapper from Cheltenham Township located in Montgomery County of Pennsylvania dropped his debut studio album titled Professional Rapper in 2015.</p><p>Apart from that, his discography includes an extended play, a mixtape, and several singles. He is most known for his 2018 single, “Freaky Friday”. He featured Chris Brown in the song which was certified platinum multiple times by RIAA (4 times) ARIA (3 times), BPI (two times), and RMNZ (once).</p><p>Admired for his comedic musical style, Lil Dicky, as far as we know, has not collaborated with Lil Durk. In terms of height, the former rapper is taller. While Lil Durk stands at 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm), Lil Dicky stands at 5 feet 11 inches (180 cm).</p><h4><strong>How Tall is Lil Durk Compared to Lil Baby?</strong></h4><p>Dominique Armani Jones is known across the world as Lil Baby and he is also an American rapper, a hip hop star from Atlanta, Georgia. Lil Baby has been active in the music industry since 2016 and has released two studio albums, six mixtapes, and one collaborative album. He has won many awards with millions of records sold, including nine nominations for Grammy Awards. In 2022, he received six nominations for the coveted award in three categories: Album of the Year, Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song, and Best Melodic Rap Performance.</p><p>For a while, it was thought that Lil Durk and Lil Baby are brothers or related in some ways. But it has been confirmed that they are nothing but friendly colleagues. The rappers have collaborated a number of times. In 2021, they dropped a collaborative studio album titled The Voice of the Heroes.</p><p>Lil Baby is 5 feet 8 inches (176 cm) tall, so he is slightly taller than Lil Durk.</p><h2><strong>Other Questions You May Have About the American Rapper</strong></h2><p>Given the level of fame that Lil Durk has attained in the entertainment industry, it is hardly a surprise that he has become someone who piques the interest of a lot of people in various areas of life.
