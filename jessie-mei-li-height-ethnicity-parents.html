Going by her birth date, she is 27 years of age as of this writing. Her birth name is Jessica Mei Li, and her zodiac sign is Virgo.</p><p>For her studies, she attended Reigate College after completing her high school education. In addition to that, she studied languages at university but dropped out very soon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Later, Mei Li enrolled at the National Youth Theatre in 2015 and trained part-time at the Identity School of Acting from 2016 to 2017.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jessie Mei Li’s parents and siblings</h2><p>As per reports, Jessie’s father’s name is Art Li, but her mother’s name is unknown. It’s also reported that her parents met each other while both of them were pursuing education at the University of Leeds in the UK.</p><p>Apart from that information, there isn’t much known about her father and mother, primarily because Mei Li prefers to stay mum when it comes to her family life. But, she has occasionally shared some tidbits during some of her interviews.</p><p>For instance, during her <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/04/shadow-and-bone-who-plays-alina-jessie-mei-li rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Vanity Fair</a>, the actress discussed about her parents and background.

Even my own dad makes fun of himself for being Asian, because that’s just how things are and how people are socialized,” she added.</p><p>Besides her parents, Jessie also has a sibling; a brother named Tom Li, who is a National Health Service (NHS) doctor in the UK. It’s currently unknown if she has other siblings, like another brother or a sister.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jessie Mei Li embraces mixed ethnicity</h2><p>As mentioned above, the Locked Up Abroad actress was born to an English mother and a Chinese father. Thus, she belongs to mixed ethnicity; half-Asian and half-Caucasian.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The actress discussed a bit more about her dual identity during her <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/entertainment/article/3129664/netflixs-shadow-and-bone-star-jessie-mei-li-being-half rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with South China Morning Post</a> in April 2021. She said, “[It’s] certainly something I felt growing up.”</p><p>“I was very Chinese to my school friends but never feeling it. So that was another thing that I felt like I could bring [to the role], this shared experience of being in one place, but not really being connected to the other [place]. But everyone else thinks you are.”</p><p>But as Jessie started to pursue acting as a future profession, her identity began to come into play. She mentioned that she would go on auditions, and sometimes, the role would be of a mixed-race character.</p><p>“And sometimes those parts would go to a fully Asian person or a fully white person, whatever, which is fine – diversity and representation, it’s great. But at the same time, I often felt like ‘OK, what am I? Where do I fit in?’” she concluded her statement.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She finds a resemblance between her role in ‘Shadow and Bone’ and her real life</h2><p>The actress, who belongs to mixed ethnicity in real life, plays a character named Alina Starkov in the series Shadow and Bone, who also happens to have a mixed race.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Talking</a> with Collider magazine in March 2021, Mei Li pointed out the similarities in ethnicity between her real life and on-screen character.</p><p>She also added that her character receives various racist comments in the series just because she belonged to a mixed race.</p><p>It was good you know there are some scenes in, you know, the first few episodes where you know you sort of see Alina having people make like racist comments to her and stuff.</p><p>But in the end, all those experiences make her strong and aspires her to achieve something big in life.</p><p>Mei Li said, “It was really interesting they’ve added that and I think it adds a lot more to sort of understand who she is as a person and why she doesn’t feel worthy. Because her journey starts off as ‘I’m no one, you know I’m just an outsider’ to suddenly being like ‘no, this is where I belong.’”</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Katy M.
